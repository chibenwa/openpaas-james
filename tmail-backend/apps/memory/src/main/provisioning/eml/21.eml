Try to have a nice weekend,
Cindy

Attached is our letter in both MS Word and Corel WordPerfect formats
offering you some help in turning your company around using our new
technologies.  Mr. Hook, our CEO talked with your secretary on 11/29/01
who requested we send this letter to you.

Thanks for your attention.

Roger Clark
