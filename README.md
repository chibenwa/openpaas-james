## Building the project

This projects uses git submodules to track the latest branch of [the Apache James project](https://james.apache.org)

After cloning this repository, you need to init the `james-project` submodule:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

It is possible that the `james-project` submodule is not in its latest state as well. If you want the latest changes
of the Apache James project, you can run as well:

```
git submodule update --remote
```

**Note**: Don't hesitate to push the latest state of the submodule in a commit if it was not up-to-date!

Then you can compile both `apache/james-project` and `linagora/openpaas-james` together.

```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
```

You can add the `-DskipTests` flag as well if you don't want to run the tests of the `apache/james-project`.

An additional `image.tag` maven property governs the tag of the built docker images and can for 
example be leveraged by build environment to achieve isolation on top of a shared docker daemon. Defaults to `latest`.

```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dimage.tag=my-unique-tag
```
